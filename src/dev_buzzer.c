 SONG format =
 for now there are periods stored as interrupts for frequencies are not implemented yet
 so - { 0.5.period_of_tone , number_of_repetitions}
 !! last element must be 0,0 -> for defining the end of a song - analogous of string
 type uint16_t
 LATER -> with interrupt
 - for frequency - frequencies in Hz = 1-32768Hz = sufficient hearable
 - for lenght of song - time in ms = 1-32.768 sec lenght of longest tone
 in case of more songs - create separate headerfile songs.h
