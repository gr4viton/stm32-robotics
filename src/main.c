\brief      This function only choses which of the 3 possible mains would run

\descrptn
    If you look here and hope to find out how this program works,
    you should look inside headerfiles on function headers to know what they do
    mainly look inside the robot_config.c and inside the struct S_robot.
    S_robot is is the core of everything.

[x] rozchodit interrupt
x] od tlacitka
x] od timeru
x] od adc -> pomoci injected a Timeru
] od adc watchdog - kdy z merenych hodnot budu menit hodnotu watchdogu?

[] priority nvic!!!
[] rozchodit pwm
[] lcd
x] 4bit
- dodelat seek
- vynechat mswait a dat to na pocet asmwait podle clocku procesoru!
